<b>Out of the project-writing hell</b><br />
I handed in my programming project yesterday. I had a pretty
good time doing the programming the past three weeks but
this week, when I had to write the paper demonstrating that
I didn't just copy the code, it turned into hell. I have a cold
that makes my head feel like a fried marshmallow. It is just
not funny at all to sit in front of the computer for a week
with a head like that, trying to write something
intelligent. I didn't succeed on the intelligent part but I
did write something, so that I could turn in 30 pages of
dumb writing.  <br />
Anyway it's all over now (except for the cold from hell, my
head does not feel like a warm marshmallow now, just a
marshmallow), and I am trying to get myself in a Christmas
mood. I know that reading <a href="http://users.resentment.org/rattie/blog/blog.html">
If Santa Answered His Mail Honestly</a> helped me get closer to
that mood while I laughed.<br />
Tomorrow I will travel all the way to the north shore of
Sealand, the island Copenhagen is on, it will take about 30
minutes (I just live in a huge country). There I will
celebrate Christmas with my family while thinking of my
girlfriend celebrating Christmas with her family on another
(even smaller) island. So from the kingdom of little
islands: <b>Merry Christmas!</b>

<b>Oh! Do you have a tattoo too?</b><br />
I have a tattoo. Lots of people have one or more so I don't
feel very special for having it. I just feel that mine is a
little special, I guess everybody thinks their tattoo is
special unless they just woke up with it someday after a
night of heavy drinking. <br />
Here is the story about mine: I was in Mexico last summer to
see all the archaeological sites I have been reading about
in the university for the last five years. I knew I wanted a
tattoo made when I was there and I knew what I wanted: a
Maya dancer dressed as a jaguar from a vase found in Altar
de Sacrificios. I traveled with some friends and the girls
were all up to having tattoos made at a tattoo shop in the
Yucatecan coast. We spend a few days getting each other all
worked up about the monstrous pain we were about to face.
Finally we gathered all our courage and went to the shop to
find the images or drawings we wanted made. I had a lot of
trouble finding my little Maya dancer, but I finally found a
copy and told the tattoo guy that I wanted it on my ankle
and leg about 15 cm high. I wanted the little guy to look
like he is dancing when I flex my ankles so he had to sit
just on the bone near the foot.
Having a tattoo made right on the thin skin over a bone is
very, very painful. Actually it hurt like hell -you can tell
by the look on my face on <a href="http://xoc.dk/older/misk/stuff/auch.html">this picture</a>.
 If you click
to see the picture you will also see a picture of the little
dancer and the vase it was taken from.<br />
The tattoo guy told me that I just had to put some Vaseline
on it a few times and that I didn't need to worry about sun,
sand, and salt water. I should not have listened to him.
After about three weeks the poor little dancer was all faded
and blurred. He still looks like that, but one day when I
get my courage up I will have it redone. I would have liked
to post a picture of what the tattoo looks like today, but I
don't have any pictures of it.<br />
I wouldn't say that I regret having a tattoo that's all
faded and ugly, but I am very bitter about having to have it
redone because it hurts!"#$. But hey, I like the little guy
-he is special to me. I guess I better like it because I
have to live with it for the rest of my life. If I ever have
another tattoo I will have it made right here in Copenhagen
by a guy who knows what he is talking about.

<b>New winterish colors!</b><br />
I am slowly getting in a Christmassy mood. I felt that my
old style sheet (that was actually called "autumnish")
needed to match the season more. The new and cool (in the cold sense)
style sheet is called "winterish". What do you think of the
colors? I like blue but maybe the old one was more cosy...

<b>Happy happy!</b><br />
Yay! I finally got the friggin Tomcat server to work together with my database! I have been struggeling to make it work for two weeks now so I feel very happy and relieved today. :-) <br />
Normally if I have some software that won't work for me I just don't use it, but I needed this server to work for my programming assignment this month. If I couldn't get it working it meant that I had to sit in the computer rooms at the university to write my programs. Anybody who has ever spend more than one hour in a room with 20 computers, 15 people, bad air, and a lunchbox-like smell will understand my joy today. <br />
Tra la la.. Merry Christmas.. la la

I always keep a very long to do list in my calendar. I
rarely cross out anything on it, as I hope for things to fix
themselves. It sometimes works, but mostly it doesn't, so I
thought that if I put it on my webpage people would remind
me of the things I forget.

John Lennon just knew how to put things; this is certainly
how I feel these days. It must be the Danish winter creeping
up on me. Winter here is grey, dark, cold and wet. I wish I
lived in a place with real winter with snow and ice so I
could go ice skating. When it finally snows here it always
thaws the next day to make things even wetter. <br />
When I'm not sleepy these days I work on a programming
project I have to turn in the 20th of December. I'm still
not too busy with it but knowing me I will probably write
half of it on the 19th. If you should ever feel like getting
really depressed you could try to install a Tomcat server on
your computer and get it to work with Java servlets and a
MySQL database. It really worked for me this week.<br />
Oh, and I'm also feeling very much like a celebrity these
days. I tried a search on Google with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=camilla%20weblog&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">
camilla weblog</a> - and I'm on the top of the list. You are
actually reading the most famous weblog owned by a Camilla.
To get my self down into the Danish winter mood again I tell
my self that Camilla is no a very used name outside of
Denmark (where it is the most common name for girls between
20 and 30), so how many weblog owning Camillas can there be?
