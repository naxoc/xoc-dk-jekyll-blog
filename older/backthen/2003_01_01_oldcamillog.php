<b>Last exam over!</b><br />
Yay! I finished the last exam this Wednesday and now I have
today and all of next week to do absolutely nothing! Nice. I
do of course have a lot of things I <i>should</i> do like
paint the ceiling in the hall, but I also just want to enjoy
my freedom a little more. Today I woke up at 9 and stayed in
bed till 12 reading - I like this life.</p>
<p>
I'm reading "Other women" by Lisa Alther and it's a little
funny because it is sooo lesbian, but it is still a very
good book. I always liked Lisa Althers way of writing. I
found <a href="http://www.strangesisters.com/">a site that
has pictures of covers from lesbian books from the 50's and
60's</a>. I guess I would not be thrilled to read those
books, but the covers are wonderfully funny.

<b>I can't believe my luck</b><br />
When I go running I always try to run as much as possible on
the grass in the park instead of on the paths. I do that
because I have an old injury from when I played handball
that makes my shins sore as hell if I run on a hard surface.
People look a little puzzled when I make my way through the
mud, but hey! I don't have to worry about crashing into
other runners when I avoid the paths. Anyway, today as I a
fought my way over the lawn in the park I found a really
cool and expensive cell phone just lying in the grass and
not a soul in sight. I picked it up and brought it home. I
had to pour the water out of it, but after doing that I
could put my SIM-card in it and turn it on. Yay! </p>
<p>
This could not have happened at a better time because my old
phone is quickly dying (phones today must be designed to
last 1 year max.). I am so lucky! Morale: travel by the path
not often taken:-)</p>
<p>
Oh, and if you lost your phone in the park today, please
e-mail me at <a href="mailto:luckybastard@yourenotgonnagetit.com">

<b>Pretzel flipz? - Yuck!</b><br />
January is the prime time of the year for diets. All
magazines here in Denmark have some sort small booklet
attached to them full of healthy recipes. I think it's a
craze but on the other hand I demand my right to moan about
my own figure at least 6 times daily so I guess I'm part of
it how ever much I hate it.</p>
<p>
Today I started out neatly with a
strawberry-grapefruit-banana smoothie for breakfast, went on
to a salmon sandwich for lunch and for supper I had steamed
cod with lots of vegetables. That is good food for a diet
right? The thing is I just quit smoking so I get these weird
cravings (I once heard someone describe smoking as an oral
fixation). So besides for my 3 meals today I had: 50g of raw marzipan, a bag of popcorn, some foul chocolate
thingies, a bagel-like bread with sesame seeds, loads of
sugary lemonade, and of course a lot of café latte with
sugar and milk.</p>
<p>
My point in sharing my food intake today with you is that
the diets in the magazines don't work! I ate some really
healthy food for all my meals today but I have a sneaking
suspicion that I will not have lost weight today. Just
because you "fry" your chicken without fat it probably won't
make your cravings for odd snacks like <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/#EpukZApEAkbwWmtnio">
pretzel flipz</a> go away. The magazines will have to do better than that.
-They could start out by choosing some models that didn't
have anorexia. If they did that maybe the designer would
start to make clothes in sizes that fit ordinary people. And
if.. OK, now I'm rambling. I just get so tired of this whole
diet show every year. And I get even more annoyed that I let
myself be part of it.

Maybe it's a little late for New Years-humor, but I found this wonderful 
<a href="http://www.thebrainstrust.co.uk/bestof2002.php">best of 2002</a> 
with some very tasteful articles
about September 11 and Saddam Hussein's moustache. Very
funny!</p>
 <p>
I also found <a

this</a> serious article about involving the American
children in the war against Iraq. </p>
<p>
I guess now that I'm almost done with my exams I have more
time to enjoy surfing the net for fun stuff instead of just
printing semester notes from the schools site. I made sort
of a New Years resolution about having more links to good
and funny stuff on the net in my weblog. I know I love when
people recommend something that I would never have found
myself.</p>

<b>I survived the usability exam</b><br />
Today was the last exam in my "3 in a week program". It was
about user friendliness in computer programs which sounds
interesting, but don't be fooled - it's sooo boring. Sadly
one of the gurus in usability, Jakob Nielsen, is Danish.
<a href="http://www.davezilla.com/">Davezilla</a> has 
<a href="http://www.davezilla.com/index.php?cat=11">made fun of him</a> in many ways 
using an interface that I understand. </p>
<p>
By the way, I think the exam today went OK. I will get my
results in a month or so, but this one I don't think I
flunked. The exam I took this Saturday I definitely think I
flunked..

I think I might have smoked a cigarette or 8 today... Not
what I had in mind for this "I quit smoking" theme i have right now but
hey! I had an exam today and then 10 hours of
hardware/OS-fighting so I'm almost excused? </p>
<p>I did have a nice long walk in the snow today though. I
always complain it never snows in Denmark but these last
days have been really beautiful. I don't think my girlfriend
agrees on that, she has to drive the car to work every
morning and when it snows here it's always chaos.

<b>Man am I going to be rich!</b><br />
As those of you that have been reading my weblog for a while
will know, I have a really bad financial situation and a
tendency to get distracted. The distraction-rate climbs
dramatically in a period of exam-reading (like now), so
while not doing what I was supposed to do today I wrote a
little function that tells me how much money I have saved
since January 2nd when I quit smoking. Its right under the 
book section to the right.</p>
<p>I find it a lot easier to quit smoking if I think of the
money I save and if I force myself to think of cigarettes as
the most stinking poison ever invented (which it is.. - see,
its working.. hehe). </p>
<p>I have an exam tomorrow, but I haven't really studied for
it. Actually I almost never study for exams, I guess my way
of getting nervous about them is to not read instead of read
like crazy like most people do. The comfortable
choice for someone like me that distracts easily.

<b>Long time no post and happy New Year!</b><br />
It's been ages since I wrote on my weblog.. Christmas, a
cold, New Years Eve, a dead computer, and a trip to Sweden
to go snowboarding kept me away from the keyboard. <br />
I had a nice Christmas with my family enjoying the quiet and
reading a lot of fiction which was nice, because I normally
read stuff with sexy titles like "Object Oriented Problem
Solving - Java, Java, Java". My grandmother has moved in
with my parents in their house, so the guest room is no
longer free to use. That meant I had to sleep on the sofa in
front of the fireplace - I don't know why I didn't always do
that, it's wonderful to be reading all night in front of the
fire. I will put some books reviews in my books section
soon.<br />
Birgitte got a CD-writer for Christmas so we spend some time
getting it to work, recording music, and printing labels.
It's so good to have a CD-Writer so the hard disks (only
5GB) can get cleaned up.
