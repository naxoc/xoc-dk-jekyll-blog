  <b>A halloween server</b><br />
Some nerds at the University of Rochester actually build a <a href="http://jacki.cif.rochester.edu/">pumpkin server</a>. It's brilliant! 100% degradeable chassis and a happy organic look. I just wonder 
why nobody came up with a mp3-prune or an mp3-eggplant before?

<b>Mars attacks!!</b><br />
Yesterday was the 65th anniversary for the broadcast of the radio play "The war of the worlds" by Orson Welles. He managed to fool the people listening to the radio into beliving that planet Earth was under attack so people paniced to the degree where they would wrap their heads in wet towels to avoid the poisonous gasses emitted by the aliens. Hehe. 
</p>
<p>
It's scary how easy it is to scare people. I can imagine Americans running around with rifles and guns scared shit.

  <b>More neat programs.</b><br />
I am slowly transforming this into a geek's weblog. But I just have to mention all the wonderful programs I have found lately.
</p>
<p>
<img class="bot" src="http://xoc.dk/older/images/things/wbloggar.png" alt="w.bloggar" />
<b><a href="http://www.wbloggar.com" title="Cool interface between you and your weblog tool">w.bloggar</a></b><br />
It's an interface between you and the weblog tool that you use (Blogger, Moveable Type or whatever). I was a little sceptic because I guess I have everything I need at the Blogger website. Especially now 
that they made new.blogger.com and even have support for other browsers than Explorer. I must say that I am impressed with their website. Anyway, w.bloggar is easy to configure, very MS-Office like 
and has built-in spellchecker, template editor and lots of other cool stuff like syntax highlighting of HTML code. If you haven't tried it with your weblog, you should. Oh, and I should mention that it's only made for windows. The guy who develops it 
has no plans to make a Mac or Linux edition. He must hate users.
</p>
<p>
<img class="bot" src="http://xoc.dk/older/images/things/fd-banner.png" alt="FeedDemon" />
<b><a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp" title="Beautiful program">FeedDemon</a></b><br />
Made by <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/" title="His company">Nick Bradbury</a> who also made HomeSite, this is a newsreader that takes in RSS and XML feeds and organizes them 
neatly. The program can brew up it's own "todays newspaper" from the sites that you want news from. In other words, no more clicking around to get the news, read weblogs, or find comic strips. 
Being a nonreligious windows person I also must say that I really think the design of this program is really beautiful. Take a look at the neat icons on  <a href="http://xoc.dk/older/images/things/FeedDemonScreenshot.png">this screenshot</a>.

</p>
<p>
<img class="bot" src="http://xoc.dk/older/images/things/Firebird.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="Firebird" />
<b><a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Firebird</a></b><br />
Is the light-weight edition of my beloved favorite browser <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I only used Firebird for a week, but I think I like it better than Mozilla already. 
It has tabbed browsing, easy organization of bookmarks and a way cooler feel than clunky Mozilla. It does not have all the features that Mozilla does, rather you can download a plugin 
if you find yourself in need of a chat relay. Also, if you want a mail client you have to download <a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> which I already like better than the 
built in one in Mozilla. 
</p>

<p>
That's it for the software-advertizing. I wonder why my friends call me a software-pusher or even "Camilla-Mozilla".

<b>OK, another great internet-thingy found</b><br />
I just saw <a href=" http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0238924/">
The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys</a>. A really good
movie I thought. And if it hadn't been good I would have
watched it all anyway, who would miss a chance to see Jodie
Foster play a nun? -I wouldn't.
I also like <a href=" http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0001085/">
Kieran Culkin</a> a lot. He is nothing like his annoying
brother Macaulay; this boy has something to offer other than
a cute smile. </p>
<p>
Anyway, the boy played by Kieran likes poetry by William
Blake. So when I was finished watching the movie I did a
search for Mr. Blake to see what he was all about. I heard
of him of course, but I never read anything by him. I got to
this really <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org.uk/main.html">
cool archive</a>,
where one can <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-dweb/blake/Illuminated-Book/@Generic__CollectionView;cv=java">
browse the
pages of his books</a> in a Java applet. That is a brilliant
symbiosis of books and technology! I saw on the website that <a href=" http://java.sun.com/">Sun
Microsystems</a> (the makers of the Java-programming
language) supports the archive. That would explain the
beautiful applets.

  <b>Enter the digital camera!</b><br />
My father has always had a great love for anything electronic. He bought a digital camera about 6 months ago. It was a plain cheap one, but good. He now
decided that it is not at all advanced enough, so he bought a really expensive new one with loads of features he will never use. That's just his way with
electronics. Anyway, he gave me the old camera! So now I have the chance to take some pictures if I remember. I have actually managed to go to Spain for 3
weeks and only take 2 pictures, so I will probably not wear the flash-card out anytime soon. </p>
<p>
I made a page where I will post some photos from time to time. You can watch me gradually become a master photographer <a

  <b>The most fantastic internet-thingy I saw in a long
time</b><br />
<a href="http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/index.htm">Ishkur
's Guide to Electronic Music</a> is so cool. It's a
Flash-app that has all the genres of electronic music
explained, exemplified with music clips and everything
neatly put on a time line (or time circle I think it is).
Ishkur proves that it is possible to use Flash for good
stuff like this instead of just annoy users with "intros"
that screeches music and colour at you when you enter a
site.</p>
<p> Go check it out. And don't forget to turn on your
speakers!
