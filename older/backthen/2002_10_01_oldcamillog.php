  <b> Spot the fancy words yourself </b><br />
I enjoy reading reviews of books and movies, in particular when it's
on somebody's homepage and not on some mercantile site. That's why I
have reviews here on my site. But.. I guess I have to face the fact
that I am not as eloquent as some of the more seasoned reviewers are
to an exorbitant degree. With the reviews on Amazon as the big
exclusion reviews are often a vast show of demonstrating the
reviewer's lucid control of language. <br />
OK. I'll cut the eloquentness now. What I really wanted was two things
:</p>
<p>
&bull; To advertise my <a href="https://xoc.dk/older/movies/">movie
reviews</a> (in plain English) page.<br />

&bull; To advertise my latest Java programming assignment from school. It
resulted in <a href="https://xoc.dk/older/misc/applets/TextApplet.html">this</a>
useless applet that will count the number of words with more than 6
letters in a text entered by a user. <br />
There. Enough advertising.

<b>Bastards! They took away my magic wand!</b> <br />

Today the bank took my credit card.. My magic piece of plastic that
got me everything I pointed it at is gone. Sob!.<br />
OK. Maybe they should have taken it 7 years ago when I first started
showing signs of total financial incompetence, but I guess they had
faith in me. It's fucking embarrassing that I, 27 years of age, simply
cannot get it into my head that the credit card is not a magic wand
that I can use as I like and never get the bill. I guess my
relationship with real money (i.e. cash) is completely screwed up. I
haven't had more than 200 Danish kroner (25 US$) on me at any time for
the last 10 years. Now I have to learn to go to the bank, take out the
money I need for say a week, and the walk around with all that cash
without spending it all at once. <br />
I really would like to be a little better at finances. I will try my
very best to be a good girl and spend my money in a sensible way and
try not to think about magic when I see an ATM... Just after I buy that
skirt I saw the other day.. Sigh!

I don't mind being a poor student most of the time. I'm good at preparing varied, healthy, and not too expensive food and my

  <b>Nice actors, poor plot</b><br />
We went to see our first film in this years <a
href="http://www.cglff.dk/">Copenhagen gay and lesbian film
festival</a> yesterday. Before the film started one of the volunteer
helpers from the festival encouraged us to grade the film on a scale
of 0 -5 when we left the cinema. I know for sure that there can be no
other film as boring as "Julie and me" so I thought that I could not
possibly have to give this one a 0. But I was a little in doubt as the
Monkey's Mask had lasted half an hour or so. Luckily the actors were
pretty nice so I ended up giving it a 2 mostly because of the good
looking actors. <br />
I'm sad to rate movies by the appearance of the actors, but it was
about the best thing I had to say about it. You can read my review of
the film <a href="https://xoc.dk/older/movies/">here</a>.<br />
I'm still looking forward to seeing "By Hook or by Crook", "Gaudi
Afternoon" and a few short films.

  <b>Your sweetest one?</b><br />
In Danish the word for girlfriend/boyfriend is "k&aelig;reste". Its kind of a sweet word I think, meaning
something like "the sweetest one" (poor translation, but it comes close). The confusing thing about this
is that, unlike in English where it would be girl- or boyfriend, it does not reveal the sex of the
sweetest one. I'm not in the closet but I don't have a need to tell everybody about my sexuality the
first day I meet them either. When I talk to new people I use the word "k&aelig;reste" about my
girlfriend as does everybody else. That way months can pass without my new friends knowing I'm gay, if
they don't ask my "k&aelig;reste's" name. Then it becomes really awkward when they come to your house and
read the names on the door, or when they ask what "he" does for a living. <br />
I'm still looking for a casual way to come out to people, but I guess the Danish language is not going to
help me out on this one.

 <b>A paperless society?</b><br />
I have now spent most of this week on the phone trying to get a certificate that states me as a bachelor from the University of Copenhagen.

I've been thinking about this "paperless society" -term and I realized that all it means is that every paper you need is non-existent until you get really angry at someone on the phone.. Back to the church books!

 <b>A film festival for all of us!</b>
The Copenhagen gay and lesbian film festival starts this Saturday. Birgitte and I already bought tickets for four movies together with some friends. The <a href=" http://www.cglff.dk/home/home_dk.html">program</a> this year actually sounds good. Last year I didn't see a single one of the films and the year before I saw two really good ones and one really really bad. It's always a pleasure to se nice women kiss, but if the rest of the movie just stinks it isn't worth it. Don't know if any of you saw <a href=" http://www.moviepie.com/filmfests/julie_and_me.htm">Julie and Me</a> but if you did: I'm sorry. That film managed to be extremely boring in both French and English at the same time.
I'm very positive this year and looking forward to this Sunday when my first movie is on.

 <b>The Hardware Whisperer</b>
Last Friday in the after school Friday-bar a friend of mine called Bo and I were joking about the free will of hardware that has been very present in my last few weeks. He agreed that it's never a good idea to upset the hardware and that it's counterproductive as hell not to be polite to it. He showed me his very unruly mouse, that after Bo accidentally dropped it once, has been very uncooperative and at times even rude. I mentioned my headstrong router and the stories were almost alike. <br />
We then thought of ways to solve our (spiritual) hardware problems and came up with a new and probably very profitable profession: the <i>Hardware Whisperer</i>. After a quick search on Google I realized that this is a goldmine! No pages were found on a "hardware whisperer" search! I will keep you posted as we set up our new business to keep peoples hardware happy and functional. If Robert Redford can make millions on a crappy movie like the Horse Whisperer, then in the tough IT-world we could make billions!

<b>Damn the FTP gods!</b>
It all started yesterday when I wanted to upload some stuff to my schools server. For some strange reason I couldn't connect. I thought that I had just messed up the settings in my FTP program, so I uninstalled it. After reinstalling it I still couldn't connect. Hmm. Then I thought it was my connection to the net, but I could view pages on the net. After about 3 hours I finally pulled the plug in the router, replugged it and.. Success! <br />
Today the called me from the place I work and asked how the page I was supposed to have uploaded last week was. I told them I was very busy (which I am), but I'd get right to it. But now the FTP gods must really hate me because of all the swearing I did yesterday I suppose, because I still can't connect! It's not the router this time so something really fishy is going on.
